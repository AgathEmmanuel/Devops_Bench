# Kubevela



KubeVela is a modern application delivery platform that makes deploying and operating applications across today's hybrid, multi-cloud environments easier, faster and more reliable.

KubeVela is infrastructure agnostic, programmable, yet most importantly, application-centric.




Application Centric  

KubeVela introduces Open Application Model (OAM) as the consistent yet higher level API to capture and render a full deployment of microservices on top of hybrid environments. Placement strategy, traffic shifting and rolling update are declared at application level. No infrastructure level concern, simply deploy.


Programmable Workflow  

KubeVela models application delivery as DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) and expresses it with CUE - a modern data configuration language. This allows you to design application deployment steps per needs and orchestrate them in programmable approach. No restrictions, natively extensible.


Infrastructure Agnostic  

KubeVela works as an application delivery control plane that is fully decoupled from runtime infrastructure. It can deploy any workload types including containers, cloud services, databases, or even VM instances to any cloud or Kubernetes cluster, following the workflow designed by you.

Note just build the ml model, but also put them in production  
Systematically plan out the lifecycle of an ML project  
- Scoping  
    - Define the project  
- Data  
    - Define data and establish baseline  
    - Label and organize data  
- Modeling  
    - Select and train model  
    - Perform error analysis  
- Deployment  
    - Deploy in production  
    - Monitor and maintain systems  

Data centric ai vs Model centric  
Caring more about data quality than data quantity

1. Data label quality  
2. Data augmentation  
3. Feature engineering  
4. Data versioning  
5. Domain knowledge  


Benefits of data-centric approach  

The advantages of becoming more data-centric are numerous, ranging from improved reporting speed and accuracy to better-informed decision-making. Data-centric infrastructure comes with lots of benefits:  
  
    Improves accuracy, using data as a strategic asset effectively assures more precise estimates, observations, and decisions.   
    Eliminates complex data transformations.  
    Reduces data errors and inconsistencies.  
    Provides valuable insights into internal and external trends that help you make better decisions.  
    Reduces expenses.  
    Makes data more accessible to key stakeholders.  
    Reduce data redundancy.  
    Improves data quality and reliability.  
  
  
  
  












MLOps is concerned with deploying the ML system and the continous evoulution of the models

MLOps principles include

-    Framing ML problems from business objectives
-    Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
-    Architect ML and data solutions for the problem
-    Data Prep and Feature Engineering
-    Model training and experimentation â€” data science
-    Model training and tuning
-    Building and automating ML pipelines
-    Deploying models to the production system
-    Model review and governance
-    Model inference and serving
-    Model monitoring, optimizing and maintainance
-    Automated model retraining
-    Explainability and interpretability


Machine Learning frameworks such as Keras, PyTorch, Tensorflow
Popular MLOps frameworks like Kubeflow, MLFlow, and DataRobot
Continuous model monitoring and maintenance with focus on:
Feedback loop
Data Drift
Seasonality
